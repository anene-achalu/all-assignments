## Algorithm:To Find Smallest Number in an Array
Input: An array arr of size n
Output: The smallest number in the array
Initialize a variable min with the first element of the array (arr[0]).
Loop through the array starting from the second element (i = 1 to n-1):
If arr[i] is smaller than min, update min = arr[i].
Return min as the smallest number.
